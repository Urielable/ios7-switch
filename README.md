iOS7 style switch
===========

- no shitty scripts, pure CSS,
- the most accurate behavior, includes `:active` state styles,
- made with `em`s, sizes approprietaly to the font size,
- supports IE9+, falls back to regular checkbox in older browsers,
- accessible from keyboard.

###Usage

Grab the css. Use it!

###Markup

    <label class="ios7-switch">
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <span></span>
    </label>

or

    <label class="ios7-switch">
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <span></span>
        Mah shitty option!
    </label>

or something else, you get the idea.

###Issues

Has some rounding error problems in some browsers at some font sizes. Tweak the font size a bit to get rid of those.

###License

You kiddin me, it's 100 rows of CSS, just use it already! Ok, here's some text for ya: [CC0 1.0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Shit, I'm so generous!
