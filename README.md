iOS7 style switch
===========

- no shitty scripts, pure CSS
- the most accurate behavior, includes `:active` state styles
- made with `em`s, sizes approprietaly to the font size

###Usage

Grab the css. Use it!

###Markup

    <label class="ios7-switch">
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <span></span>
    </label>

or

    <label class="ios7-switch">
        <input type="checkbox" checked>
        <span></span>
        Mah shitty option!
    </label>

or something else, you get the idea.

###Limitations

- Doesn't work in IE8 and lower. Make a fallback if you need it, you lazy bastard!
- Has some rounding error problems in some browsers at some font sizes. Tweak the font size a bit to get rid of those.
